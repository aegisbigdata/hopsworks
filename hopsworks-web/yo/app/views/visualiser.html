                        <h1>Deployment</h1>
                            <p>Visualizer is implemented with python as a Jupyter notebook. Here, we describe how the tool can be utilized from the AEGIS platform.</p>
                            <h2>STEP 1(Optional) - Install the notebook</h2>
                                <p>If the Jupyter notebook does not already exist in a specific project, one should first 
                                    <a href="https://github.com/aegisbigdata/query-builder/archive/master.zip">download</a> it. Then, upload the 
                                    Visualizer.ipynb file into Jupyter from the corresponding menu, as seen in figure below</p>
                                <p><img src="images/9.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Upload Notebook"></p>
                            <h2>STEP 2 - Open the notebook</h2>
                                <p>Once the notebook is present, click on it to open. You will see the following:</p>
                                <p><img src="images/1.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Visualizer Initial State"></p>
                                <p>This is the initial state. All code cells are hidden by using the <a href="https://github.com/kirbs-/hide_code">
                                        hide code plugin</a> and also all output has been cleared.</p>
                            <h2>STEP 3 - Initialize the notebook</h2>
                                <p>Disable code hidding in the first cell by unchecking "Hide Code" box. When the code unfolds, you will see something 
                                    like this:</p>
                                <p><img src="images/0.png" style="width: 100%" alt="First Cell Code"></p>
                                <p>Then, you should edit the variables <strong>project_user</strong> and <strong>project_name</strong> accordingly. 
                                    <strong>project_name</strong> is the name of the project currently working with. For the <strong>project_user</strong> variable the rule is a little bit more complex. Username is a string that consists of a total of 8 characters and involves the user's first part of the email (before the @). If this part contains more than 8 characters, the first 8 are used and the rest are truncated. On the contrary, if it less than 8 characters, we fill any remaining empty positions with zeros. Finally, any dot (.) characters are being replaced by underscores (_).
                                For instance, a user with email <a href="mailto:testuser@domain.com">testuser@domain.com</a> would have a username 
                                "testuser". One with email <a href="mailto:test.user@domain.com">test.user@domain.com</a> would have a username "test_use" and finally, one with email <a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a> would have "user0000".</p>
                                <p>After editing those two variables, hide again the code in the first cell, make sure the cell is selected and 
                                    either click on the "Run" button from the top Jupyter menu, or press ctrl+enter.</p>
                            <h2>STEP 4 - Working with the visualiser</h2>
                                <p>Now that everyhting is set, the first widget that appears is something like a file picker, where a user can 
                                    navigate between the files stored in the current project and open a desired one. Note that currently only CSV 
                                    files are supported.</p>
                                <p><img src="images/2.png" style="width: 100%" alt="File Picker"></p>
                                <p>Once a file is open, a small preview in tabular format will be shown</p>
                                <p><img src="images/3.png" style="width: 100%" alt="File Preview"></p>
                                <p>Afterwards, a list with the available visualization types will be displayed. Pick a desired type and click on 
                                    the <strong>Apply</strong> button.</p>
                                <p><img src="images/4.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Visualization Types"></p>

                                <p>For every visualization type, a widget with various options depending on the type will be opened. Fill mandatory 
                                    fields with the desired values and then click on the <strong>Visualize</strong> button.</p>
                                <p><img src="images/5.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Parameters"></p>
                                <p><img src="images/6.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Parameters Filled"></p>
                                <p>Pay attention to the parameter called <strong>Position</strong>. This actually refers to the position on the 
                                    dashboard that we would like to place the chart to. If you notice in the previous picture, there are five empty 
                                    cells in the end of the notebook. Those act as placeholders for the dashboard. Currently only up to five different charts at the same time are supported, but this can be easily extended. The dashboard can contain several charts from the same dataset or even from different ones. When a new dataset is openned, previous charts are not deleted.</p>
                                <p>A sample chart that appers after filling the necessary options can be seen below.</p>
                                <p><img src="images/7.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Sample Scatter Plot"></p>
                            <h2>STEP 5 - Cleaning up</h2>
                                <p>When you have completed your work with the visualiser, it is highly recommended to clear all the output, so you 
                                    can do a fresh start without any leftovers the next time. This can be achieved from Jupyter's top menu. Choose 
                                    <strong>Cell -&gt; All Output -&gt; Clear</strong></p>
                                <p><img src="images/8.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Clear Output"></p>
                    <h1>Important Notes</h1>
                        <p>All the instructions above refer to the Visualizer as a standalone notebook. In future work step 1 will be dropped, 
                            since the notebook would we automatically available in every newly created project. Furthermore, when the integration 
                            with the other two notebooks takes place(Query Builder, Algorithm Execution Container), step 3 will also be dropped, 
                            and the file reading part from step 4 will be utilized from the Query Builder.</p>

                <h1>A. Quick Introduction to the AEGIS tools</h1>
                    <p>AEGIS offers various tools to address the diverse needs of its users:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>AEGIS Integrated Services</p>
                            <p>The AEGIS platform provides multi-tenant data management and processing services for Big Data, allowing different 
                                users and services to securely and privately access and process their data and share them with other users, allowing 
                                access for specific services. In order to do that, AEGIS builds upon Hopsworks, which also enables AEGIS to provide 
                                integrated support for various services such as interactive notebooks with Zeppelin and Jupyter, Kafka, and ELK 
                                stack.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Query Builder</p>
                            <p>Query Builder provides the capability to interactively define and execute queries on data available inside AEGIS. 
                                Query Builder aims to simplify and accelerate the process of retrieving data and creating views on them, which 
                                could be then saved as new datasets or used as input for more high-level AEGIS tools, like the Visualiser and the 
                                Algorithm Execution Container</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Visualiser</p>
                            <p>The Visualiser is the component enabling the visualisation capabilities of the AEGIS platform for the output of 
                                the querying and filtering results coming from the Query Builder as well as the output of the analysis results 
                                as produced from the Algorithm Execution Container.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Algorithm Execution Container</p>
                            <p>This component features a UI that consists of an algorithm selection template, which offers to users some basic 
                                information regarding each algorithm available in the big data analysis platform of AEGIS and also enables the 
                                configuration and the execution of the selected algorithm.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The Data Harvester and Annotator</p>
                            <p>The Data Harvester and Annotator features several sub-components which, in connection, represent the process of 
                                harvesting, transforming, harmonising, annotating and providing the required data and metadata for the AEGIS 
                                platform.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The previous tools are the ones that the users directly interact with through the core AEGIS platform. There are also some 
                        tools working "under the hood" to enable certain functionalities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AEGIS Linked Data Store, which is responsible for storing the metadata associated with a particular dataset within the 
                            AEGIS platform</li>
                        <li>Brokerage Engine, which includes elements of the Data Policy and the Business Brokerage framework.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finally, AEGIS offers two optional offline tools, specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An anonymisation tool, which is an extensible, schema-agnostic plugin that allows real-time efficient data 
                            anonymisation.</li>
                        <li>A cleansing tool that enables data validation, data cleansing and data completion processes towards increasing the r
                            eliability, accuracy and completeness of the data that will be imported in the AEGIS platform</li>
                    </ul>
                <h1>B. Getting started workflow</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to the AEGIS platform! The following lines aim to help you familiarise yourself with the platform and begin using 
                        our various tools and services.</p>
                    <h2>Part 1 - First visit step by step</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create a new account in the platform and wait for your activation e-mail.</li>
                            <li>Welcome! You are now in the AEGIS home page, where you can browse our assets, i.e. our projects and datasets. Search 
                                around a bit to see what we have!</li>
                            <li>When you have looked around enough, it's time to move on to do more interesting things and for that, you will need a 
                                project! You might have come to AEGIS through an invitation to join a project, so you may find yourself in an already 
                                populated workspace. But we'll assume that's not the case for this intro. So, go ahead and create a project by 
                                pressing the yellow button on the right</li>
                            <li>You are now in the project's home page. From here you can review the last actions performed by the project users 
                                (currently only you). The menu on the left is the entrance point to the various offered tools. Please note the 
                                cluster utilisation percentage right under the menu, it shows the current work load on the cluster and it will be 
                                affected by the things you do in the platform as well.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Project Datsets" menu option. From here you can explore the available datasets and of-course upload 
                                more data in your project. You will find six datasets already there, which are necessary parts of every project. 
                                Don't mind them for now. Go ahead and create another dataset by pressing the yellow button on the right. After that, 
                                you can upload some files in your new dataset - make sure to upload some csv files as well to use in our next steps. 
                                When the upload is over, select one of the uploaded files and notice the hdfs path that appears in the yellow box on 
                                the right. You may need this path in the future, so make sure you remember how to find it.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Visualiser" menu option. For more information on how this tool is used and what you can do with it, you 
                                may refer to <a href="https://github.com/aegisbigdata/documentation/wiki/Visualizer">this guide</a>. For now, just 
                                try loading one of your previously uploaded csv files and then choose a simple visualisation.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Query Builder" menu option. Let's assume that in the previous step, when using the Visualiser, you would 
                                have wanted to filter out some values prior to visualising the data. Follow the provided instructions  
                                <a href="https://github.com/aegisbigdata/documentation/wiki/Query-Builder">here</a> to perform this simple task. 
                                The guide provides information for more advanced tasks as well and you can always try things on your own to find 
                                out exactly what you can do.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Analytics" menu option. Again, for information about what you can do with this tool and how, you may 
                                refer to <a href="" title="Coming soon">this guide</a>. 
                                Here you will need that hdfs path from step 5. Copy it and go ahead to try the tool!</li>
                            <li>Go to the "Metadata Designer" menu option. From here you can add metadata to your data which are used for enhanced 
                                search and may also, under the hood, facilitate some data management processes. This part may seem a bit advanced, 
                                but keep in mind it's there. For now keep experimenting in steps 5-8 and you will gradually understand what metadata 
                                offer and you may even decide to contribute yourself! Take a look 
                                <a href="" title="Coming soon">here</a> when you are 
                                ready to know more!</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h2>Part 2 - Advanced options</h2>
                        <p>Once you familiarise yourslef with the processes described in the first tour, you will understand how the related tools 
                            can be leveraged to enable and/or facilitate various data management and processing tasks. At the same time, you may 
                            realise some limitations and you may want to move on to more advanced operations. There are four menu options not 
                            included in the first part, that offer exactly these capabilities:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Jupyter menu option: This will open another window with Jupyter Notebook, i.e. an open-source web application that 
                                allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses 
                                include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine 
                                learning, and more (see also <a href="http://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow">Jupyter website</a>. You have already seen 
                                Jupyter in the first tour, since Visualiser and Query Builder are built inside this notebook. We support the 
                                sparkmagic Jupyter kernel, which is used to run Spark applications.</li>
                            <li>Zeppelin menu option: This will take you to Apache Zeppelin, which is also a web-based interactive notebook with 
                                support for various interpreters, including Spark and Angular.</li>
                            <li>Jobs menu option: This will take you to the AEGIS UI that provides support for running Jobs. Jobs could be Spark 
                                applications or Spark workflows and they can be scheduled for periodic execution or run on-demand.</li>
                            <li>Kafka: This will take you to the Kafka management page. AEGIS supports Kafka-as-a-Service. Kafka topics (used as 
                                channels for producing/consuming messages) are private to projects and users can create a topic with just a few 
                                clicks. Topics can also be shared with other projects enabling real-time communication between projects.</li>
