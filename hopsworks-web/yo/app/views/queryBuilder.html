                <h1>Deployment and Usage</h1>
                    <p>Query Builder is implemented with python, html and javascript as a Jupyter notebook. Here, we describe how the tool can be utilized 
                        from the AEGIS platform.</p>
                <h2>STEP 1(Optional) - Install the notebook</h2>
                    <p>If the Query Builder Jupyter notebook does not already exist in a specific project, you should first 
                        <a href="https://github.com/aegisbigdata/query-builder/archive/master.zip">download</a> it. Then, upload the QueryBuilder_v1.ipynb 
                        file into Jupyter from the corresponding menu, as seen in figure below</p>
                    <p><img src="images/9.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Upload Notebook"></p>
                <h2>STEP 2 - Open the notebook</h2>
                    <p>Once the notebook is present, click on it to open. You will see the following:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/QB18.png" style="width: 100%" alt="QB Initial State"></p>
                    <p>This is the initial state. All code cells are hidden and all output has been cleared. If you are not interested in reviewing or 
                        altering the code (it is not required in the standard workflow) you may proceed with hiding the cell toolbars.
                        In order to do that, select "View" from the menu, then "Cell Toolbar" and click on the "None" option, as shown below.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/QB19.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Hide Toolbar"></p>
                    <p>You should now see the following screen</p>
                    <p><img src="images/QB1.png" style="width: 100%" alt="QB Initial State No Toolbar"></p>
                <h2>STEP 3 - Initialize the notebook</h2>
                    <p>Run the first cell: Make sure that the first cell is selected and either click on the "Run" button from the top Jupyter menu, or 
                        press ctrl+enter.
                    You should see a button appearing as shown below.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/QB2.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Initialise Notebook"></p>
                    <p>Click on the button and wait for the execution to stop. When this is donw, you should see a screen like the one below, where all 
                        cell prompts have been replaced by numbers and a simple UI with two buttons has appeared.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/QB3.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Initialised QB"></p>
                    <p>Note that the output regarding the Spark application will only appear when the interpreter is started. This means that if the 
                        "Initialise QB" button is pressed again, the message will disappear, but the tool will be still functional.</p>
                <h2>STEP 4 - Working with the Query Builder</h2>
                    <h3>Selecting a file</h3>
                        <p>Query Builder offers two ways of exploring available files, each one corresponding to the two initial buttons.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>Metadata Browser</strong> button shows the available datasets according to information from the metadata repository. 
                            For each dataset, the title, description, contact point, publisher and relevant keywords are provided.</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB13.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Metadata Browser Datasets"></p>
                        <p>By selecting a dataset, its contents (individual files) are presented:</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB12.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Metadata Browser Files"></p>
                        <p>If you press the "open" button of a file, then the file is loaded (as a PySpark Dataframe) and becomes available for further 
                            processing/querying.</p>
                        <p>This data browsing is mostly intended for users exploring projects with a lot of data who are not yet certain which particular 
                            files they are interested in. If you already know which file you want to open, you should press the <strong>Local Browser
                            </strong> button and select the file from the dropdown list that will appear (as shown below):</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB4.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Local Browser"></p>
                        <p>Once you choose a file and press the select button, the file will be loaded (as a PySpark Dataframe) and become available for 
                            further processing/querying.</p>
                        <p>Dataframes are essentially data tables. At each moment, Query Builder has two Dataframes: the <strong>temporary dataframe
                            (tempDF)</strong> which holds the result of the last performed action, i.e. the contents of a file or the result of 
                            applying a filter/query on the previous contents of tempDF and the <strong>master dataframe (MasterDF)</strong> which is 
                            explicitly updated by pressing a button that moves the tempDF contents to the MasterDF.</p>
                    <h3>Manipulating the temporary Dataframe (tempDF)</h3>
                        <p><img src="images/QB5.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Loaded file"></p>
                        <p>When a file is loaded, a form appears with several options for simple data filtering and processing.</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB7.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Filters form"></p>
                        <p>Each selected action will open a new form with the necessary parameters. Once you fill the required information and press OK 
                            a new filter will be added in the queue to be applied when you want. As an example, if you choose the "Rename Column" filter 
                            you will need to select which column to rename and which should be the new name.</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB9.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Rename column"></p>
                        <p>Once you press OK, the filter will be added in the queue, under the "Selected Filters" label</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB8.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Rename Col Filter"></p>
                        <p>You may add more than one such filters before executing them. They will be added in the same list:</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB10.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Filter List"></p>
                        <p>When you want to apply them, click on the "Apply Filters" button. When the execution is finished, all successfully applied 
                            filters will have changed colour:</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB11.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Executed Filters"></p>
                        <p>You may continue adding new filters after that point. The list will show both which filters have been already applied and 
                            which are pending:</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB14.png" style="width: 100%" alt="All filters"></p>
                    <h3>Previewing the contents of a Dataframe</h3>
                        <p>By pressing the "Refresh temp" button, you will get the first 40 lines of the tempDF.</p>
                        <p>This is useful both when you first load a file but also to review the result of applying some filters</p>
                        <!--p><img src="images/QB6.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Temp Preview 1"></p>
                        <p>but also to review the result of applying some filters</p-->
                        <p><img src="images/QB15.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Temp Preview 2"></p>
                        <p>A "Refresh Master" button is also available to preview the contents of the master Dataset. Keep in mind that the two 
                            Dataframes may hold completely different data. You may also join the two Dataframes through the corresponding option in the 
                            filters form. The result will be kept in the tempDF.</p>
                        <p><img src="images/QB17.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Temp and Master Preview"></p>
                <h2>STEP 5 - Cleaning up</h2>
                    <p>You may load, process and combine data following the previous steps in any order, until you are satisfied with the end-result. 
                        At any time, you may press the "Initialise QB" button to clear the screen and start over. When you have completed your work 
                        with the Query Builder, you may either directly exit the Notebook or clear all the output first so that you can have a fresh 
                        start without any leftovers the next time. This can be achieved from Jupyter's top menu. Choose 
                        <strong>Cell -&gt; All Output -&gt; Clear</strong></p>
            <h1>Important Notes</h1>
                <p>All the instructions above refer to the Query Builder as a standalone notebook and may be changed in future integrated versions.</p>

                <h1>A. Quick Introduction to the AEGIS tools</h1>
                    <p>AEGIS offers various tools to address the diverse needs of its users:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>AEGIS Integrated Services</p>
                            <p>The AEGIS platform provides multi-tenant data management and processing services for Big Data, allowing different 
                                users and services to securely and privately access and process their data and share them with other users, allowing 
                                access for specific services. In order to do that, AEGIS builds upon Hopsworks, which also enables AEGIS to provide 
                                integrated support for various services such as interactive notebooks with Zeppelin and Jupyter, Kafka, and ELK 
                                stack.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Query Builder</p>
                            <p>Query Builder provides the capability to interactively define and execute queries on data available inside AEGIS. 
                                Query Builder aims to simplify and accelerate the process of retrieving data and creating views on them, which 
                                could be then saved as new datasets or used as input for more high-level AEGIS tools, like the Visualiser and the 
                                Algorithm Execution Container</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Visualiser</p>
                            <p>The Visualiser is the component enabling the visualisation capabilities of the AEGIS platform for the output of 
                                the querying and filtering results coming from the Query Builder as well as the output of the analysis results 
                                as produced from the Algorithm Execution Container.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Algorithm Execution Container</p>
                            <p>This component features a UI that consists of an algorithm selection template, which offers to users some basic 
                                information regarding each algorithm available in the big data analysis platform of AEGIS and also enables the 
                                configuration and the execution of the selected algorithm.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The Data Harvester and Annotator</p>
                            <p>The Data Harvester and Annotator features several sub-components which, in connection, represent the process of 
                                harvesting, transforming, harmonising, annotating and providing the required data and metadata for the AEGIS 
                                platform.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The previous tools are the ones that the users directly interact with through the core AEGIS platform. There are also some 
                        tools working "under the hood" to enable certain functionalities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AEGIS Linked Data Store, which is responsible for storing the metadata associated with a particular dataset within the 
                            AEGIS platform</li>
                        <li>Brokerage Engine, which includes elements of the Data Policy and the Business Brokerage framework.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finally, AEGIS offers two optional offline tools, specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An anonymisation tool, which is an extensible, schema-agnostic plugin that allows real-time efficient data 
                            anonymisation.</li>
                        <li>A cleansing tool that enables data validation, data cleansing and data completion processes towards increasing the r
                            eliability, accuracy and completeness of the data that will be imported in the AEGIS platform</li>
                    </ul>

                            <li>When you have looked around enough, it's time to move on to do more interesting things and for that, you will need a 
                                project! You might have come to AEGIS through an invitation to join a project, so you may find yourself in an already 
                                populated workspace. But we'll assume that's not the case for this intro. So, go ahead and create a project by 
                                pressing the yellow button on the right</li>
                            <li>You are now in the project's home page. From here you can review the last actions performed by the project users 
                                (currently only you). The menu on the left is the entrance point to the various offered tools. Please note the 
                                cluster utilisation percentage right under the menu, it shows the current work load on the cluster and it will be 
                                affected by the things you do in the platform as well.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Project Datsets" menu option. From here you can explore the available datasets and of-course upload 
                                more data in your project. You will find six datasets already there, which are necessary parts of every project. 
                                Don't mind them for now. Go ahead and create another dataset by pressing the yellow button on the right. After that, 
                                you can upload some files in your new dataset - make sure to upload some csv files as well to use in our next steps. 
                                When the upload is over, select one of the uploaded files and notice the hdfs path that appears in the yellow box on 
                                the right. You may need this path in the future, so make sure you remember how to find it.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Visualiser" menu option. For more information on how this tool is used and what you can do with it, you 
                                may refer to <a href="https://github.com/aegisbigdata/documentation/wiki/Visualizer">this guide</a>. For now, just 
                                try loading one of your previously uploaded csv files and then choose a simple visualisation.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Query Builder" menu option. Let's assume that in the previous step, when using the Visualiser, you would 
                                have wanted to filter out some values prior to visualising the data. Follow the provided instructions  
                                <a href="https://github.com/aegisbigdata/documentation/wiki/Query-Builder">here</a> to perform this simple task. 
                                The guide provides information for more advanced tasks as well and you can always try things on your own to find 
                                out exactly what you can do.</li>
                            <li>Select the "Analytics" menu option. Again, for information about what you can do with this tool and how, you may 
                                refer to <a href="" title="Coming soon">this guide</a>. 
                                Here you will need that hdfs path from step 5. Copy it and go ahead to try the tool!</li>
                            <li>Go to the "Metadata Designer" menu option. From here you can add metadata to your data which are used for enhanced 
                                search and may also, under the hood, facilitate some data management processes. This part may seem a bit advanced, 
                                but keep in mind it's there. For now keep experimenting in steps 5-8 and you will gradually understand what metadata 
                                offer and you may even decide to contribute yourself! Take a look 
                                <a href="" title="Coming soon">here</a> when you are 
                                ready to know more!</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h2>Part 2 - Advanced options</h2>
                        <p>Once you familiarise yourslef with the processes described in the first tour, you will understand how the related tools 
                            can be leveraged to enable and/or facilitate various data management and processing tasks. At the same time, you may 
                            realise some limitations and you may want to move on to more advanced operations. There are four menu options not 
                            included in the first part, that offer exactly these capabilities:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Jupyter menu option: This will open another window with Jupyter Notebook, i.e. an open-source web application that 
                                allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses 
                                include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine 
                                learning, and more (see also <a href="http://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow">Jupyter website</a>. You have already seen 
                                Jupyter in the first tour, since Visualiser and Query Builder are built inside this notebook. We support the 
                                sparkmagic Jupyter kernel, which is used to run Spark applications.</li>
                            <li>Zeppelin menu option: This will take you to Apache Zeppelin, which is also a web-based interactive notebook with 
                                support for various interpreters, including Spark and Angular.</li>
                            <li>Jobs menu option: This will take you to the AEGIS UI that provides support for running Jobs. Jobs could be Spark 
                                applications or Spark workflows and they can be scheduled for periodic execution or run on-demand.</li>
                            <li>Kafka: This will take you to the Kafka management page. AEGIS supports Kafka-as-a-Service. Kafka topics (used as 
                                channels for producing/consuming messages) are private to projects and users can create a topic with just a few 
                                clicks. Topics can also be shared with other projects enabling real-time communication between projects.</li>
